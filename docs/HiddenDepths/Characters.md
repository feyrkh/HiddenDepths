[[Grantham]] - the kindly head instructor. He quietly chooses a student each year to groom as one of his personal harem - stunting their growth in magic by tricking and coercing them into growing a bond with himself rather than branching out with others. He has a connection to [[Sensual Harmony]] and [[Ecstasy Pulse]]
[[Trin]] - Grantham's teacher's aide for this year. She is one of the victims of his subtle maneuvering to make his aides solely reliant on him for their magical advancement. She is so connected to him, and so convinced it would be a waste of time to connect with others and waste all the work she has put in with Grantham, that she is cold to everyone else. She has a connection to [[Ardor Ripple]] and [[Connection Aura]].
[[Valefor]] - mischievous instructor, secretly a demon who is bound to the academy. He gains power by talking students into breaking taboos and social restrictions, but has trouble finding things to do in an academy of sex magic. His ultimate goal is to overthrow Grantham and take control of the labyrinth himself. He has a connection to [[Passion Cascade]] and [[Lustful Gleam]]
[[Emi]] - a shy student, out of place at the academy but her family refused to let her waste her potential. She secretly sneaks out and performs acts of guerilla art - sculptures and graffiti showing up in odd places. She has a connection to [[Ravishing Ember]], [[Eros Resonance]] and [[Devotion Spark]]. 
[[Aria]] - a popular student who seems to have it all, but she harbors a dark secret - her connection to magic is twisted, and fueled by pain as much as by intimacy. She has a secretly tender disposition, with a connection to [[Heartfire Radiance]] and [[Embrace Echo]], and is ashamed of her magic's sadistic tendencies. She hides the shame with a polished and superior false personality.
[[Kael]] - a brooding exchange student from a primitive tribe, with a talent for magic that brought him to the academy. He has a connection to [[Ecstasy Pulse]] and [[Ardor Ripple]]. He was secretly sent to the academy by his tribal elders to sabotage it, opening a way for their invasion, but he hates the idea.
