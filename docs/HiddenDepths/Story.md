Hidden Depths takes place in the Abyssal Ardor Institute of Esoteric Intimacy, a research academy built on top of a deep and monster-haunted labyrinth. The player is a student starting her first year of study. The institute has three purposes: 
- to train new practitioners in esoteric intimacy, also known as "magic"
- to uncover new knowledge about the magical arts
- to prevent the demons of the abyss for which the institute is named from building up strength and escaping

There are several intertwined storylines - one following each of the player's classmates and instructors, and an overarching story related to progress in the abyss. See [[Characters]] for links to individual stories.

# Abyss plot overview
As the player ventures deeper into the abyss beneath the academy, they encounter powerful creatures who serve as guardians of each layer. These beings, once noble and honorable, have been corrupted by the malevolent influence of the abyss, forced to fight against their will. Only through defeating them can they briefly break free from their bonds and share glimpses of their tragic stories with the player.

1. With each layer of the abyss the player traverses, they face off against a formidable boss monster, each one a prisoner of their own nature and enslaved by the darkness. After defeating them in combat, the player is granted a moment to converse with the defeated guardian, who struggles to break free from the corruption that binds them.
    
2. Through these conversations, the player learns of the guardians' tragic pasts and the circumstances that led to their imprisonment within the abyss. They hear tales of betrayal, loss, and despair, as the guardians reveal the depths of their suffering and the torment they endure.
    
3. Moved by the guardians' plight, the player vows to help them find redemption and break free from the chains of their corruption. They embark on a quest to uncover the source of the abyss's influence and put an end to the darkness that threatens to consume the world.
    
4. As the player delves deeper into the abyss, they uncover clues and hints that lead them to the source of the corruption - a monstrous entity lurking in the darkest depths of the abyss. This entity, once a benevolent protector, has been twisted and warped by the malevolent energies of the abyss, becoming the very embodiment of its corruption.
    
5. In a climactic showdown, the player faces off against the monstrous entity that resides at the heart of the abyss, battling against the darkness in a desperate bid to restore balance to the world. With courage and determination, they confront the source of the corruption and fight to free the guardians from their eternal bondage.
    
6. In the aftermath of the battle, the player's actions determine the fate of the abyss and its inhabitants. Through their bravery and compassion, they may succeed in breaking the cycle of corruption and freeing the guardians from their torment, allowing them to find peace and redemption at last. Alternatively, they may choose not to permanently destroy the monster, allowing them to continue the cycle that allowed them to grow powerful and close to their classmates.
