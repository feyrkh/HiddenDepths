# Unlocking effects
Spell effects can be researched in the [[Library]]. A handful of books are present at the beginning of the game, and more can be retrieved from the dungeon. It takes a minimum time to research an effect, and once researched you can create a [[Rituals|Ritual]] that can produce the effect. Continuing to research after the ritual is complete will increase your comprehension of the effect, allowing you to produce higher level rituals.


# Temporary effects
Most effects give you the *capacity* to increase your stats or unlock special abilities, but you must power them up while in the dungeon - you start each combat run with low power and choose rewards after finishing rooms which empower your spell effects.

# Permanent effects
Some effects, especially stat effects, can be made permanent once you have a level of temporary ability in them. This is an expensive operation.
