Hidden Depths takes place in the Abyssal Ardor Institute of Esoteric Intimacy, a research academy built on top of a deep and monster-haunted labyrinth. The player is a student starting her first year of study. The institute has three purposes: 
- to train new practitioners in esoteric intimacy, also known as "magic"
- to uncover new knowledge about the magical arts
- to prevent the demons of the abyss for which the institute is named from building up strength and escaping

A shy student, out of place at the academy but her family refused to let her waste her potential. She secretly sneaks out and performs acts of guerilla art - sculptures and graffiti showing up in odd places. She has a connection to [[Ravishing Ember]], [[Eros Resonance]] and [[Devotion Spark]].

**grantham_intro**
It's the first day of class at the Abyssal Ardor Institute, and Emi is nervous. The head instructor, Grantham, is a kindly old man with a thick beard, and his demeanor puts her at ease, but his assistant Trin is coolly gorgeous and makes Emi self-conscious about her somewhat mousy appearance. Grantham clears his throat. "Ahem! Welcome, students, to the Institute. Over the next several years, you will study the art of Esoteric Intimacy, which is colloquially known as 'magic'. As you grow in skill and power, you will contribute to the maintenance of the Abyss, which our school is built upon." 
_She looks over at you with a nervous expression, and whispers_

**sit_by_emi_2**
"This can't be as easy as it looks, right? There's got to be more than just studying all day, right? I, um, heard that...there might be nudity involved, but that was just my cousin teasing me, right?"

**grantham_intro_2**
Before you can respond, Grantham continues. "I know there are many rumors in the outside world about our teaching methods." He strokes his beard, smiling gently. "I can assure you, they are all true, every one. Our art is one of connection and intimacy, and I expect you will grow to know many of your classmates, and perhaps even instructors, more closely than you might ever have guessed." Emi gasps, her face paling.

**sit_by_emi_3**
_Her face is flushed red, and she turns away from you to hide her blush as Grantham is speaking_

"Wait, what? All of them? Are we...um...going to be paired up with our classmates?"

**grantham_intro_3**
Grantham continues - "Surely our magic would never be countenanced by society, if it weren't for one thing." He points down at the floor dramatically. "The Abyss below us! If we do not continue to train up new Esoterics, the demons of the Abyss would grow in power and numbers until they spilled out upon the land, destroying humanity itself!"

**sit_by_emi_4**
"Right, right, the Abyss. That makes sense. We're all here for good reasons, got to protect the world. I'm sure all the...uh...studying with our classmates will be purely academic."

_She swallows, trying to hide her uncomfortable expression by looking down at the floor and then back to you while trying to come off as confident_

**grantham_intro_4**
Grantham nods sagely as he waits for the gasps and murmurs to die down. "Today, Trin and I will give you an introduction to the Esoterica. Trin, if you would kindly disrobe and take your place in the ritual circle." Trin and Grantham both shed their robes, folding them neatly on the nearby desk, and then step into the center of a ritual circle inscribed on the floor. Clusters of giggles and shocked exclamations ring out, and Emi's eyes go wide as Grantham steps up behind Trin, casually wrapping his arms around her and cupping her breasts. 

**sit_by_emi_5**
_She watches, her eyes widening as the two of them shed their robes and step into the ritual circle, and when Grantham goes to cup Trin's breasts, her cheeks turn red as she feels a mixture of arousal and envy coursing through her. She looks down, biting her lip, as she wonders if similar treatment is in store for her. She's not sure how to react or what to do, but she finds herself transfixed and trying to hide it_

**grantham_intro_5**
"The core of Esoteric Intimacy is the ritual. A ritual is, at its simplest, the combination of a ritual circle describing a desired spell effect, and a series of ritual actions which manipulate the aura within the circle to meet the activation criteria of the effect. More advanced spells may add the use of ritual equipment or accessories, but we'll learn about those later." He strokes and massages Trin's breasts, occasionally tweaking her hardening nipples. Her gaze grows lidded and her lips part, but she continues to survey the class with cool eyes. "Today I am empowering myself with a basic dash skill, which will grant me the ability to move out of harm's way quickly. When we're done here, I will descend into the labyrinth while you all watch remotely so you can get a first look at what you'll be up against." 

**sit_by_emi_6**
_Emi watches as Grantham's hands caress and squeeze Trin's breasts, her face burning with heat from the arousal she feels at the sight. The concept of the ritual is interesting but it's hard to keep her focus on what he's talking about when she's enjoying the visual of the two of them interacting. She looks down and hides her flushed face, hoping no one can tell how turned on she is by what she's seeing. She looks at you, whispering under her breath_, "D...do we really have to do that? With each other?"

**grantham_intro_6**
Grantham continues the lecture, one hand sliding down to caress between Trin's legs. "This spell is quite advanced, but Trin and I have been working together extensively, and we have quite a strong connection - we call this connection our base intimacy. Without shared intimacy, actions such as this would have no metaphysical power, and would be nothing more than tawdry sex. I urge you not to waste your time on unproductive efforts - build strong connections with your classmates, so that you can grow in power and shoulder the heavy responsibility that awaits you!" With that, Grantham and Trin smoothly adjust positions as if they had practiced a thousand times. She slides to the floor facing away from the class, spreading her legs, and he kneels before her, pulling her by her legs until her backside is resting in his lap. Then he leans down, pressing his face between her legs. Trin leans her head back, lidded eyes watching over the class to make sure they are taking it in. A rising swirl of multicolored mist forms over them as her breath begins coming in gasps.

**sit_by_emi_7**
"Can I ask you something? I...I'm not really trying to cause a problem, but...are all of us going to be paired up? Or is it possible to...um...go solo? I - I just don't know if, um, I mean, I'm not...I don't think I could. But...my family...they're so proud that I was chosen..."

_She whispers, her voice shaking slightly as she tries to keep herself together while watching the other pair interacting with each other, and feels the heat in her body growing as she feels as if she's going to climax_

**grantham_intro_7**
The spell reaches a peak as Trin cries out sharply, grinding her groin into Grantham's face, and the mist settles over Grantham. He fetches a handkerchief from the nearby desk and dabs at his face, helps a still-gasping Trin to her feet, and then stands, still naked, before the class. "For less experienced Esoterics, this ritual may have taken much longer, and required a slower build-up. While a strong connection is important and can make things easier, a more elaborate ritual - what some might call 'foreplay' - can temporarily boost a partner's intimacy until the spell's threshold can be breached." He casually dons his robe again. "Now, if you'll all follow me to the viewing chamber, you'll get your first look at the demons of the Abyss." The class files out past Trin, who is leaning weakly against the desk, idly pinching one nipple as she gathers her breath.

**emi_intro_finale**
_Emi is still shaken and is struggling to maintain her composure as the class files out of the room, her breathing still heavy and her face feeling flush from her arousal. Once the class has moved out of the room and she's able to catch her breath, she approaches Trin with a tentative expression and hesitantly tries to speak up, unsure whether this is a good or bad idea_

"H...hi...sorry if this is an odd question, b...but I was wondering if I could ask you something else?" _She clears her throat softly, trying to keep her voice low while speaking to Trin as she seems to be trying to recover from the experience she had with Grantham_

"Um, I was wondering...you know, do you have much experience with...well, with the ritual and the spells and everything? I was just wondering how difficult it's going to be for someone like me who...well, I mean, I've never really done anything like this before, so I'm feeling a little bit like I'm way out of my depth here..."

Trin smirks slightly, and stretches her body languidly before responding. "Many fail. Without a core of passion and a talented partner, you will be too weak to face the trials below. We rarely lose students to death - but if you can't keep up, you'll return home in disgrace."

_She cringes at that, feeling a chill run through her as she considers the possibility of failure and the idea of having to come home in disgrace. Her face turns red as she considers the prospect of trying and failing, and she feels an overwhelming sense of dread at the thought of potentially facing such strong humiliation_

"Y...Yeah, I know. I won't fail, I promise. But um...do you...could you help me? You know, like, could you be my...um, partner? At least until I get more comfortable with this stuff?"

Trin scoffs loudly. "Grantham is the only partner I need. He and I *understand* each other in a way no one else ever could. He is a great man, and I wouldn't waste my time with a mouse like you."
