A ritual starts with a spell effect and the level of the spell that will be invoked, and a target - either the player's body or a piece of equipment. This defines a set of attributes that the ritual needs. Spell effect targets may be restricted to one or more of these types:
- person
- weapon
- armor
- accessory

After selecting the target, one or more [[Ritual Thresholds]] will be determined. Each [[Ritual Thresholds|Ritual Threshold]] is a set of attributes which the ritual must overcome (for positive) or not fall below (if negative). For example, a simple threshold might be:
Eros Resonance: (-2 to 2)
Lustful Gleam: (5+)

Each action affects multiple thresholds, but they will be filtered to the ritual you choose
Caress Cheek, Intimacy 1 (Lustful Gleam +1, Eros Resonance +2, Endurance -1, Momentary Intimacy +1)
Chaste Kiss, Intimacy 2 (Eros Resonance -1, Endurance -1, Momentary Intimacy +1)
Kiss Neck, Intimacy 4 (Lustful Gleam +4, Endurance -1, Momentary Intimacy +1)

If your [[Intimacy]] is at 1 with your assistant, the only action you can take is Caress Cheek. This will change the ritual aura to (LG+1, ER+2), cost 1 endurance, and increase your intimacy to 2. The intimacy increase unlocks the Chaste Kiss action. If you tried to Caress Cheek again, the aura would rise to (LG+2, ER+4) - this puts you out of the bounds of the ritual for Eros Resonance, so you need to reduce it. 

Instead, you might see that Kiss Neck will unlock if you raise your intimacy a bit more, so instead of a second Caress Cheek you might use Chaste Kiss twice. This brings the ritual aura to (LG+1, ER=0), costs 2 more endurance, and raises your momentary intimacy to 4, enough to use Kiss Neck. That brings the aura to (LG+5, ER=0), bringing total endurance cost to 4, completing the ritual.

Additional modifiers might include assistant special abilities which increase the allowed range of certain thresholds, items which increase/decrease the effect of certain thresholds, etc.
