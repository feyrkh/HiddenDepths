Player: It's the first day of orientation at the Abyssal Ardor Institute of Esoteric Intimacy, a prestigious but secretive research academy. The selection process was a gruelling ordeal, challenging your quickness of wit, mental fortitude, and physical capabilities, but you passed with flying colors and were granted a full scholarship with the promise of a research position if you graduate. The opportunity was too good to pass up, so here you are!
Player: As you enter the lecture hall, you find that most of the seats are already filled. Only two remain open, on opposite ends of the hall.
